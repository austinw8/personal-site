Secret codes can be used to send fun messages between friends! Encrypt makes it easy to create, write, and send an encoded message to your buddies.

The goal of `encrypt` is to provide a fun collection of easy-to-use functions for encrypting and decrypting messages using classic ciphers. This package is perfect for friends and enthusiasts looking to add cryptic fun to their messages.

***NOTE: This is not end-to-end encryption and should not be considered secure. It’s just a fun way to send messages to others.***

## Installation

You can install the development version of encrypt from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("austinw8/encrypt")
```

## Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of three, the letter ‘A’ becomes ‘D’, ‘B’ becomes ‘E’, and so on.

This is a basic example of how to use `caesar_cipher()`:

```r
library(encrypt)

caesar_cipher("attack at dawn", 3)
#[1] "dwwdfn dw gdzq"

caesar_cipher("12345", 5)
#[1] "67890"

caesar_cipher("abcde", -2)
#[1] "yzabc"
```

## Atbash Cipher
Atbash Cipher is a substitution cipher with just one specific key where all the letters are reversed. That is, A to Z and Z to A. It was originally used to encode the Hebrew alphabets but it can be modified to encode any alphabet. 

Because the alphabet is simply mirrorwd, `atbash_cipher()` can both encrypt and decrypt. Here’s an example:

```r
library(encrypt)

atbash_cipher("Hebrew alphabet")
#[1] "svyivd zokszyvg"

atbash_cipher("svyivd zokszyvg")
#[1] "hebrew alphabet"
```

## Vigenère Cipher
Vigenere Cipher is a substitution method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. Invented by the French cryptologist Blaise de Vigenère in the 16th century, it’s based on a shift cipher to which the keyword is added that changes the shift at each step.

Using `vigenere_cipher()` is as simple as entering the phrase you want encoded followed by the keyword:

```r
library(encrypt)

vigenere_cipher("Short cuts make long delays", "ring")
#[1] "jpbxk khzj unqv tbtx lrrrgf"

vigenere_cipher("make it happen", "math")
#[1] "yadl ut ahbpxu"
```

## Morse Code
Morse code is a popular binary method of communicating. Each Morse symbol represents either a letter or number and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes.

```r
library(encrypt)

morse_code("Holy biscuits batman")
#[1] ".... --- .-.. -.-- / -... .. ... -.-. ..- .. - ... / -... .- - -- .- -."

morse_code("12345")
#[1] ".---- ..--- ...-- ....- ....."
```

## Polybius Square
A Polybius Square, or Polybius Cipher, is a substitution cipher that allows someone to convert letters into numbers, or vise versa. Each character of the plain message is replaced by a couple of coordinates defining its position in the grid.

*Note: In order to fit the 26 letters of the alphabet into the 25 cells created by the table, the letters ‘i’ and ‘j’ are usually combined into a single cell. Originally there was no such problem, since the Greek alphabet only has 24 letters. 

Here’s an example of how to use `polybius_square()`:

```r
library(encrypt)

polybius_square("Hello friends")
#[1] "23 15 31 31 34   21 42 24 15 33 14 43"

polybius_square("3511331311251543")
#[1] "pancakes"

polybius_square("24 45 33 24 34 42")
#[1] "junior"
```
